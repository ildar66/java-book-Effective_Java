    2 Creating and Destroying Objects (chapter02):
        Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors.
        Item 2: Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters.
        Item 3: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type.
        Item 4: Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor.
        Item 5: Avoid creating unnecessary objects.
        Item 6: Eliminate obsolete object references.
        Item 7: Avoid finalizers.
    3 Methods Common to All Objects (chapter03):
        Item 8: Obey the general contract when overriding equals.
        Item 9: Always override hashCode when you override equals.

        Item 19: Use interfaces only to define types.
        Item 20: Prefer class hierarchies to tagged classes.
        Item 21: Use function objects to represent strategies.
        Item 22: Favor static member classes over nonstatic.
    5 Generics (chapter05):
        Item 23: Donâ€™t use raw types in new code.
        Item 24: Eliminate unchecked warnings.
        Item 25: Prefer lists to arrays.
        Item 26: Favor generic types.
        Item 27: Favor generic methods.
        Item 28: Use bounded wildcards to increase API flexibility.
        Item 29: Consider typesafe heterogeneous containers.
    6 Enums and Annotations (chapter06):
        Item 30: Use enums instead of int constants.
        Item 31: Use instance fields instead of ordinals.
        Item 32: Use EnumSet instead of bit fields.
        Item 33: Use EnumMap instead of ordinal indexing.
        Item 34: Emulate extensible enums with interfaces.
        Item 35: Prefer annotations to naming patterns.
        Item 36: Consistently use the Override annotation.
        Item 37: Use marker interfaces to define types.
    7 Methods (chapter07):
        Item 38: Check parameters for validity.
        Item 39: Make defensive copies when needed.
        Item 40: Design method signatures carefully.
        Item 41: Use overloading judiciously .
        Item 42: Use varargs judiciously.
        Item 43: Return empty arrays or collections, not nulls.
        Item 44: Write doc comments for all exposed API elements.
    8 General Programming (chapter08):
        Item 45: Minimize the scope of local variables.
        Item 46: Prefer for-each loops to traditional for loops.

        Item 50: Avoid strings where other types are more appropriate.
        Item 51: Beware the performance of string concatenation.
        Item 52: Refer to objects by their interfaces.
        Item 53: Prefer interfaces to reflection.
