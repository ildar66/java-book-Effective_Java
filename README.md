Effective Java(customary and effective usage):
    1 Introduction (chapter01).
    2 Creating and Destroying Objects (chapter02):
        Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors.
        Item 2: Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters.
        Item 3: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type.
        Item 4: Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor.
        Item 5: Avoid creating unnecessary objects.
        Item 6: Eliminate obsolete object references.
        Item 7: Avoid finalizers.
    3 Methods Common to All Objects (chapter03):
        Item 8: Obey the general contract when overriding equals.
        Item 9: Always override hashCode when you override equals.
        Item 10: Always override toString.
        Item 11: Override clone judiciously.
        Item 12: Consider implementing Comparable.
    4 Classes and Interfaces (chapter04):
        Item 13: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members.
        Item 14: In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields.
        Item 15: Minimize mutability.
        Item 16: Favor composition over inheritance.
        Item 17: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it.
        Item 18: Prefer interfaces to abstract classes.
        Item 19: Use interfaces only to define types.
        Item 20: Prefer class hierarchies to tagged classes.
        Item 21: Use function objects to represent strategies.
        Item 22: Favor static member classes over nonstatic.
    5 Generics (chapter05):
        Item 23: Donâ€™t use raw types in new code.
        Item 24: Eliminate unchecked warnings.
        Item 25: Prefer lists to arrays.
        Item 26: Favor generic types.
        Item 27: Favor generic methods.
        Item 28: Use bounded wildcards to increase API flexibility.
        Item 29: Consider typesafe heterogeneous containers.
    6 Enums and Annotations (chapter06):
        Item 30: Use enums instead of int constants.
        Item 31: Use instance fields instead of ordinals.
        Item 32: Use EnumSet instead of bit fields.
        Item 33: Use EnumMap instead of ordinal indexing.
        Item 34: Emulate extensible enums with interfaces.
        Item 35: Prefer annotations to naming patterns.
