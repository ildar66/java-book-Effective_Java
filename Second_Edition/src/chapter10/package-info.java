/**
 * Concurrency.
 * *
 * THREADS allow multiple activities to proceed concurrently.
 * Concurrent programming is harder than single-threaded programming,
 * because more things can go wrong, and failures can be hard to reproduce.
 * But you canâ€™t avoid concurrency. It is inherent in much of what we do, and a requirement
 * if you are to obtain good performance from multicore processors, which are now commonplace.
 * *
 * This chapter contains advice to help you write clear, correct, well-documented concurrent programs.
