/**
 * Item 45: Minimize the scope of local variables.
 * *
 * The most powerful technique for minimizing the scope of a local variable is to declare it where it is first used.
 * *
 * Nearly every local variable declaration should contain an initializer. One exception to this rule concerns try-catch statements.
 * *
 * Prefer for loops to while loops(assuming the contents of the loop variable arenâ€™t needed after the loop terminates).
 * @see chapter08.item45.Sample
 * *
 * A final technique to minimize the scope of local variables is to keep methods small and focused.
 * If you combine two activities in the same method,
 * local variables relevant to one activity may be in the scope of the code performing the other activity.
 * To prevent this from happening, simply separate the method into two: one for each activity.
