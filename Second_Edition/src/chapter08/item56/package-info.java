/**
 * Item 56: Adhere to generally accepted naming conventions.
 * *
 * The Java platform has a well-established set of naming conventions,
 * many of which are contained in The Java Language Specification [JLS, 6.8].
 * *
 * For quick reference, the following table shows examples of typographical conventions:
 * Identifier:                       |             Type Examples:
 * Package                           |      com.google.inject, org.joda.time.format
 * Class or Interface                |      Timer, FutureTask, LinkedHashMap, HttpServlet
 * Method or Field                   |      remove, ensureCapacity, getCrc
 * Constant Field                    |      MIN_VALUE, NEGATIVE_INFINITY
 * Local Variable                    |      i, xref, houseNumber
 * Type Parameter                    |      T, E, K, V, X, T1, T2
 * *
 * To summarize, internalize the standard naming conventions and learn to use them as second nature.
 * The typographical conventions are straightforward and largely unambiguous;
 * the grammatical conventions are more complex and looser.
 * To quote from The Java Language Specification [JLS, 6.8],
 * “These conventions should not be followed slavishly if long-held conventional usage dictates otherwise.” Use common sense.
