/**
 * Item 47: Know and use the libraries.
 * *
 * By using a standard library, you take advantage of the knowledge of the experts
 * who wrote it and the experience of those who used it before you.
 * *
 * Numerous features are added to the libraries in every major release, and it pays to keep abreast of these additions.
 * Every programmer should be familiar with the contents of java.lang, java.util, and, to a lesser extent, java.io.
 * *
 * To summarize, don’t reinvent the wheel. If you need to do something that seems like it should be reasonably common,
 * there may already be a class in the libraries that does what you want. If there is, use it; if you don’t know, check.
 * Generally speaking, library code is likely to be better than code that you’d write yourself and is likely to improve over time.
 * This is no reflection on your abilities as a programmer.
 * Economies of scale dictate that library code receives far more attention than most developers could afford to devote to the same functionality.
