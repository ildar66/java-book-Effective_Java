/**
 * Item 41: Use overloading judiciously.
 * *
 * @see chapter07.item41.CollectionClassifier
 * Because the classify method is overloaded, and the choice of which overloading to invoke is made at compile time.
 * *
 * Selection among overloaded methods is static, while selection among overridden methods is dynamic. {@link chapter07.item41.Overriding}
 * *
 * You should avoid confusing uses of overloading.
