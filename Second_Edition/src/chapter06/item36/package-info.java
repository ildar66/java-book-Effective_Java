/**
 * Item 36: Consistently use the Override annotation.
 * *
 * @see chapter06.item36.Bigram
 * *
 * Use the @Override annotation on every method declaration that you believe to override a superclass declaration.
 * *
 * In summary,
 * the compiler can protect you from a great many errors if you use the @Override on every method declaration
 * that you believe to override a supertype declaration, with one exception. In concrete classes, you need
 * not annotate methods that you believe to override abstract method declarations (though it is not harmful to do so).
