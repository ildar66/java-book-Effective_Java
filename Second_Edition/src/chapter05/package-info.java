/**
 * Generics.
 * *
 * In release 1.5, generics were added to Java.
 * Before generics, you had to cast every object you read from a collection.
 * If someone accidentally inserted an object of the wrong type, casts could fail at runtime.
 * With generics, you tell the compiler what types of objects are permitted in each collection.
 * The compiler inserts casts for you automatically and tells you at compile time if you try to insert an object of the wrong type.
 * This results in programs that are both safer and clearer, but these benefits come with complications.
 * This chapter tells you how to maximize the benefits and minimize the complications.
