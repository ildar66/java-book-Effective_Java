 * clone method for a hash table whose internals consist of an array of buckets, each of which
 * references the first entry in a linked list of key-value pairs or is null if the bucket is empty.
 * For performance, the class implements its own lightweight singly linked list instead of using

         * because it consumes one stack frame for each element in the list. If the list is long, this could easily cause a stack overflow.
