/**
 * Item 10: Always override toString.
 * *
 * Providing a good toString implementation makes your class much more pleasant to use.
 * see {@link chapter03.item10.PhoneNumber}
 * *
 * When practical, the toString method should return all of the interesting information contained in the object.
 * *
 * Whether or not you decide to specify the format, you should clearly document your intentions.
 * *
 * Provide programmatic access to all of the information contained in the value returned by toString.
