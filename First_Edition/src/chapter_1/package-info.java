/**
 * Introduction chapter.
 * This book is designed to help you make the most effective use of the Javaâ„¢ programming
 * language and its fundamental libraries, java.lang, java.util, and, to a lesser extent,
 * java.io. The book discusses other libraries from time to time, but it does not cover graphical
 * user interface programming or enterprise APIs.
 * This book consists of fifty-seven items, each of which conveys one rule. The rules capture
 * practices generally held to be beneficial by the best and most experienced programmers.
 * The items are loosely grouped into nine chapters, each concerning one broad aspect of
 * software design. The book is not intended to be read from cover to cover: Each item stands on
 * its own, more or less. The items are heavily cross-referenced so you can easily plot your own
 * course through the book.
 * Most items are illustrated with program examples. A key feature of this book is that it
 * contains code examples illustrating many design patterns and idioms.
