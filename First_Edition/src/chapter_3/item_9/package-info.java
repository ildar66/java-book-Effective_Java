/**
 * Item 9: Always override toString.
 * Providing a good toString implementation makes your class much more pleasant to use.
 * When practical, the toString method should return all of the interesting information contained in the object
 * Whether or not you decide to specify the format, you should clearly document your intentions.
 * It is always a good idea to provide programmatic access to all of the information contained in the value returned by toString
