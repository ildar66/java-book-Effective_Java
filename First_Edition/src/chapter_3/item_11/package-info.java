/**
 * Item 11: Consider implementing Comparable.
 * 
 * The general contract for the compareTo method is similar in character to that of the equals method.
 * Here it is, copied from the specification for Comparable:
 * Compares this object with the specified object for order.
 * Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.
 * Throws ClassCastException if the specified object's type prevents it from being compared to this object.
