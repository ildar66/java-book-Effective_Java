/**
 * Item 38: Adhere to generally accepted naming conventions.
 *
 * Table 7.1. : Examples of Typographical Conventions
 * Identifier Type Examples
 * Package: com.sun.medialib, com.sun.jdi.event
 * Class or Interface: Timer, TimerTask, KeyFactorySpi, HttpServlet
 * Method or Field: remove, ensureCapacity, getCrc
 * Constant: Field VALUES, NEGATIVE_INFINITY
 * Local Variable: i, xref, houseNumber
 *
 * To summarize, internalize the standard naming conventions and learn to use them as second
 * nature. The typographical conventions are straightforward and largely unambiguous;
 * the grammatical conventions are more complex and looser. To quote from The Java
 * Language Specification [JLS, 6.8], “These conventions should not be followed slavishly if
 * long-held conventional usage dictates otherwise.” Use common sense.
