/**
 * Item 44:Document all exceptions thrown by each method.
 * *
 * Always declare checked exceptions individually,
 * and document precisely the conditions under which each one is thrown using the Javadoc @throws tag.
 * *
 * Use the Javadoc @throws tag to document each unchecked exception that a method can throw,
 * but do not use the throws keyword to include unchecked exceptions in the method declaration.
 * *
 * If an exception is thrown by many methods in a class for the same reason, it is
 * acceptable to document the exception in the class's documentation comment.
