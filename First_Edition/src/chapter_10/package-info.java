/**
 * Chapter 10. Serialization.
 * *
 * This chapter concerns the object serialization API, which provides a framework for encoding objects as byte streams
 * and reconstructing objects from their byte-stream encodings.
 * Encoding an object as a byte stream is known as serializing the object; the reverse process is known as deserializing it.
 * Once an object has been serialized, its encoding can be transmitted from one running virtual machine to another or stored on disk
 * for later deserialization. Serialization provides the standard wire-level object representation for remote communication,
 * and the standard persistent data format for the JavaBeans™ component architecture.
